摘要
混合波束成形技术是一种结合数字波束成形和模拟波束成形的先进无线通信技术。相较于传统数字波束成形技术，它采用更少的射频链，在维持较高频谱效率的同时，降低了传输功耗和硬件成本。在研究混合波束成形通信系统时，通常需要求解相关的优化问题。凸优化算法凭借其坚实的数学理论基础，成为解决此类优化问题的重要工具。然而，这种方法往往存在迭代次数多、运算时间长的局限性。随着深度学习技术的快速发展，深度展开算法通过将凸优化算法与深度神经网络深度融合，大幅提升了优化问题的求解效率。尽管如此，深度展开算法也存在其固有的缺陷。因此，无论是凸优化算法还是深度展开算法，都具有重要的研究价值。本文旨在深入研究基于凸优化算法和深度展开算法的混合波束成形通信系统，以期为未来通信系统的设计和优化提供有价值的指导和建议。本文主要完成以下几点工作:
首先，针对混合波束成形通信系统难以实现多种附加功能的局限性，本文提出一种能同时满足数据通信，无线充电以及防窃听功能的混合波束成形下行链路系统，并采用半正定松弛法与惩罚性凹凸逼近法来求解相关优化问题。与现有的研究相比，此项工作在混合波束成形通信系统中实现了更多的附加功能，为实现集数据通信，无线充电和防窃听一体的混合波束成形系统提供了一种切实可行的方案。
其次，针对凸优化算法存在的迭代次数多、运算时间长的不足，本文提出了一种基于深度展开的改进方法。具体而言，本文将梯度投影法进行深度展开，并将其应用于混合波束成形通信系统相关优化问题的求解中。与传统的梯度投影法相比，该方法显著减少了迭代次数和运算时间。此外，其逐步骤的可解释性结构有效规避了深度神经网络常见的黑盒特性问题。 
最后，结合前两章的仿真实验结果，深入探讨深度展开算法相较于传统凸优化算法的优势和局限性，重点分析两者在运算效率，求解能力，鲁棒性以及适用场景上的差异。并得出结论，深度展开算法无法完全取代传统的凸优化算法，因此在混合波束成形系统的设计过程或其它实际应用中，需要根据优化问题的特点合理选择优化方法。

Abstract
Hybrid beamforming technology is an advanced wireless communication technique that combines digital beamforming and analog beamforming. Compared to traditional digital beamforming, it employs fewer radio frequency chains, maintaining high spectral efficiency while reducing transmission power consumption and hardware costs. As such, it is one of the key technologies for 5G and future communication systems. In the study of hybrid beamforming communication systems, it is often necessary to solve related optimization problems. Convex optimization algorithms, with their solid mathematical theoretical foundation, have become an important tool for addressing such optimization problems. However, these methods often suffer from limitations such as a high number of iterations and long computation times. With the rapid development of deep learning techniques, deep unfolding algorithms, which integrate convex optimization algorithms with deep neural networks, have significantly improved the computational efficiency of solving optimization problems. Nevertheless, deep unfolding algorithms also have inherent drawbacks. Therefore, both convex optimization algorithms and deep unfolding algorithms hold significant research value. This paper aims to conduct an in-depth study of hybrid beamforming communication systems based on convex optimization and deep unfolding algorithms, providing valuable guidance and recommendations for the design and optimization of future communication systems. The main contributions of this paper are as follows,
Firstly, addressing the limitation that hybrid beamforming communication systems struggle to achieve multiple additional functionalities, this paper proposes a hybrid beamforming downlink system capable of simultaneously supporting data communication, wireless charging, and eavesdropping prevention. The system employs Semidefinite Relaxation and the Penalty Convex-concave Procedure to solve the related optimization problems. Compared to existing research, this work achieves more additional functionalities in hybrid beamforming communication systems, offering a feasible solution for a system that integrates data communication, wireless charging, and eavesdropping prevention.
Secondly, to address the shortcomings of convex optimization algorithms, such as a high number of iterations and long computation times, this paper proposes an improved method based on deep unfolding. Specifically, the Gradient Projection method is unfolded and applied to solve optimization problems in hybrid beamforming communication systems. Compared to the traditional Gradient Projection method, this approach significantly reduces the number of iterations and computation time. Additionally, since each step of the method is interpretable, it effectively overcomes the inherent black-box nature of deep neural networks.
Finally, based on the simulation results from the previous two chapters, this paper thoroughly explores the advantages and limitations of deep unfolding algorithms compared to traditional convex optimization algorithms, with a focus on analyzing their differences in computational efficiency, problem-solving capability, robustness, and applicable scenarios. The conclusion is drawn that deep unfolding algorithms cannot entirely replace traditional convex optimization algorithms. Therefore, in the design process of hybrid beamforming systems or other practical applications, it is necessary to select the appropriate optimization method based on the characteristics of the optimization problem
